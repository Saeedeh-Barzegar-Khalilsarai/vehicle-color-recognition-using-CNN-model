# vehicle-color-recognition-using-CNN-model

## Description
> In this project, we have used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for detecting vehicle color. The colors are used in this project:
> Beige, Black, Blue, Brown, Gray, Green, orange, Red, Silver, White, Yellow.

>Hint: Dataset and training files are not available, Until the paper related this project will be published. Meanwhile, you are able to utilize test models for predicting vehicle color by using model weights named `color_model.h5` and prediction code in Google Colab named `color_prediction.ipynb`
>

>Creating an input file named `input` containing images.
>

## Road map for predicting vehicle color:
>First step: Mount your google colab drive by using below instructions:
>
```
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive/')
import os
os.chdir("/content/drive/MyDrive/train python/IMAGE-AI")
!ls
```

>Second step:
